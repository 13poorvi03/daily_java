This repository marks the beginning of my journey into learning Java. I’ve just started exploring the language, so the code here is simple, basic, and focused on understanding the fundamentals rather than building large projects.
My goal with this repo is to keep track of whatever I learn—whether it’s basic syntax, variables, loops, methods, or the core ideas of object‑oriented programming.
I’m adding programs slowly as I practice, experiment, and get more comfortable with Java. 
Even though the number of files is small right now, each one represents a concept I’ve understood and implemented on my own.
Over time, as I learn more topics and improve my coding style, this repository will grow and become a more complete record of my progress in Java programming.
